              <p>It's been a long timeâ€¦<br/>
              Honestly, I've lost track of how many times I wanted to talk, wanted to tell you something â€” but stayed quiet. Perhaps because your silence was already louder than words. Perhaps because I knew I was never truly part of your world.<br/><br/>
              Nevertheless, when I did see you today â€” your smileâ€¦ your eyesâ€¦<br/>
              It brought it all back. All the emotions I had tried to suppress. I was attracted to you, not simply because of the way you appeared, but because something about you brought back the image of someone I became close to<br/><br/>
              It's your birthday today â€” and despite we've never had decent conversations, and despite I know you've been avoiding meâ€¦ I couldn't let the day go by without telling you this.<br/><br/>
              <b>Happy birthday.</b><br/><br/>
              I don't expect anything from you. I never have. But I just needed you to understand that forgetting you hasn't been easy. Your memories have a tendency to linger, even when your presence doesn't.<br/><br/>
              Perhaps you'll never get what I saw in you. Perhaps you'll never even care. And that's fine. But this â€” this was something I had to tell you. For me.
